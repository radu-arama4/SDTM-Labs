# Topic: *Behavioral Design Patterns*
## Author: *Drumea Vasile*
------
## Objectives:
&ensp; &ensp; __1. Study and understand the Behavioral Design Patterns;__

&ensp; &ensp; __2. As a continuation of the previous laboratory work, think about what communication between software entities might be involed in your system;__

&ensp; &ensp; __3. Implement some additional functionalities using behavioral design patterns;__

## Theoretical background:
&ensp; &ensp; In software engineering, behavioral design patterns have the purpose of identifying common communication patterns between different software entities. By doing so, these patterns increase flexibility in carrying out this communication.

&ensp; &ensp; Some examples from this category of design patterns are :

   * Chain of Responsibility
   * Command
   * Interpreter
   * Iterator
   * Mediator
   * Observer
   * Strategy
   
## Main tasks :
&ensp; &ensp; __1. By extending your project, implement as many behavioral design patterns as you need in your project:__
  * The implemented design pattern should help to perform the tasks involved in your system;
  * The object creation mechanisms/patterns can now be buried into the functionalities instead of using them into the client;
  * The behavioral DPs can be integrated into you functionalities alongside the structural ones;
  * There should only be one client for the whole system;
  
&ensp; &ensp; __2. Keep your files grouped (into packages/directories) by their responsibilities (an example project structure):__
  * client;
  * domain;
  * utilities;
  * data(if applies);
  
&ensp; &ensp; __3. Document your work in a separate markdown file according to the requirements presented below (the structure can be extended of course):__
  * Topic of the laboratory work;
  * Author;
  * Introduction/Theory/Motivation;
  * Implementation & Explanation (you can include code snippets as well):
    * Indicate the location of the code snippet;
    * Emphasize the main idea and motivate the usage of the pattern;
  * Results/Screenshots/Conclusions;

## Evaluation :
&ensp; &ensp; __1. The project should be located in the same repository as the previous lab;__

&ensp; &ensp; __2. It is allowed to use libs, but only for facilities like:__
  * Text processing;
  * UI creation (if necessary);
  * Other libs that don't contain implemented DPs and which do not do smth that you can do yourself; 

&ensp; &ensp; __3. In order to make the evaluation as optimal as possible we will have a quiz on this topic with the following format:__
  * Everyone has 1 attempt;
  * The quiz will be open for a week;
  * After finishing the quiz only the score is available;
  * The detailed results (wrong/right answers) are available after it is closed;
  * Have 1 min per question;

&ensp; &ensp; __4. The mark of the lab is based on the project and the quiz (50%/50%);__

&ensp; &ensp; __5. Submit the repository URL on ELSE;__

&ensp; &ensp; __6. The deadline for this assignment is 5.12.2020;__

&ensp; &ensp; __7. The laboratory works can be defended either online or at the university during the seminar;__
